Description
----------------
* launch data over time
* shift from private to commercial
* highlighting some disasters

```{python}
agencies = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-01-15/agencies.csv")
launches = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-01-15/launches.csv")


launches["launch_date_dt"] = pd.to_datetime(launches.launch_date, errors = 'coerce')
```

```{python}
(launches
  >> count(_.launch_year, _.agency_type)
  >> ggplot(aes("launch_year", "n", color = "agency_type"))
   + geom_line()
   + labs(x = "Time", y = "# of launches this year", color = "Agency type")
  )
```

```{python}
from datetime import datetime
datetime.now()
```

```{python}
launches >> count(_.agency_type, _.agency, sort = True)

agencies >> count(_.state_code, wt = _.count, sort = True)

     ))
   >> mutate(state_name = fct_lump(_.state_code, 6).fillna('Other'))
  )

```

```{python}
(launches_processed
  >> count("launch_year", "state_name")
  >> mutate(state_name = fct_reorder(_.state_name, -_.n, np.sum))
  >> ggplot(aes("launch_year", "n", color = "state_name"))

## Focus on private + startup launches

```{python}

  >> filter(_, _.agency_type.isin(['private', 'startup']))
  >> inner_join(_,
       agencies >> select(_, "agency", _.agency_name == "name", "short_name", "parent"),
       "agency"
       )
  # note unlike R, mutate can't take same named arg twice in python
  >> mutate(_, agency_name_lumped = fct_lump(_.agency_name, 6))
  >> mutate(_,
      agency_name_lumped = if_else(
         (_.agency_name_lumped == "Other") & (_.state_name == "US"),
         "Other US",
         _.agency_name_lumped
         )
       )
  )
